A Keylogger in Python

# Usage
- Double-click file and it will run in the background
- If no "keylog.txt" file is found it will create a text file in the same directory
- Change variables "maxTime" and "saveInterval" for the maximum time limit the keylogger runs for and the intervals the keylogger saves to the file.
- Press the ESCAPE key 3 times in a row to save and quit
